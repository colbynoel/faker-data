1. For the things that Faker can generate, let it generate it. Otherwise, utilize an LLM to create some fake data. Use LlamaFile to generate the reviews

2. Figure out a way to create a relationship with all of the tables while generating the fake data.

3. Create a local database to store the fake data

4. Create a fastapi service around the fake data to query it.

5. Create authentication around the api service (not really, but kinda)

6. Dockerize and Kubernetes 

7. Create terraform code to spin up the service
